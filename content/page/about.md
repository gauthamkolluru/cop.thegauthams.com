Hi,

My name is **Gautham Kolluru** and I hail from **Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India**.

I hold a bachelors degree in **Computer Science** and thats because I love Electronics, Computers, Technology, Mathematics, Programming and (last but no way the least) *solving problems efficiently*.

I officially started teaching since my 2nd year at college (at a local institute during my 1st year break) in 2006.

In my ~2 decades of teaching, I worked as a Trainer for **Full-Time** for about an year at ***[Talent Sprint](https://talentsprint.com/en-us?srsltid=AfmBOorxIgjv7wuw5idmxc3O7whX6zLnOlILOawYxaIYQZIh0pxuHWSa)***. I taught **Python**, **Django** and **Machine Learning** at 2 colleges for them and also trained 2 batches of Tata Consultancy Service's new recruits in Python and Machine Learning.

So far I taught: ***C***, ***Python***, ***SQL***, ***NoSQL***, ***Django***, ***Machine Learning***.

Though I've been predominantly working as a Software Developer, I have been teaching in parallel because ***I love teaching*** and the quotes below,

> Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. - Lao Tzu

> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough - Richard Feynman
