## Overview

We start with what a **Python virtual machine** means and go all the way till (and including) **Object Oriented Programming** in Python and also cover the **functional programming** constructs of the language.

With this knowledge, the learner will be in a better position of choosing which way to go further, be it _Web Development (Front-end / Back-end / Full Stack), Automation, Data Engineering, Data Science, etc..._ 


## Prerequisites

Anyone above 7 years of age (apparantly as per online researches) can learn Python!

No prior experience is required (but if you have some sort of programming experience can only help).

## Why learn Python?

- Python is widely considered to be one of the best first programming language to learn.
- Python is one of the most prominent programming languages in the fields of STEM and beyond.
- You are starting a career in software development and Python can help understand the terrain sooner and better.
- You are the middle of your career, looking for a pivot or a promotion, Python can abridge the gap between you and your dream role.
- You are on the top level management in your career, Python can help you make data driven decisions giving you an edge in the industry
